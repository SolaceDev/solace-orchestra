# Orchestra Hero UI (Game Controller)

The UI for the Solace Orchestra

# Instruction

Create a lib directory and copy the solclient-debug.js to that location. Also create a credentials.js file in the lib directory with the following information:

```javascript
var hosturl = "ws://mr-91b692du2x.messaging.solace.cloud:20643";
var vpn = "msgvpn-91b69332x9";
var username = "solace-cloud-client";
var pass = "abcdefghijklmnop";
```

(with the real password of course)

Then point your broswer to the index.html file or host it on a web server.
